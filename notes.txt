Ok here are my notes for this project.
9/16/22: 
Here are the descriptions as per my knowledge and some of the definitions are provided in the 'Data' section.

    IUD - Intra Uterine Device (a form of contraceptive)
    STDs - Sexually Transmitted Diseases
    HPV - Human Papilloma Virus
    HIV - Human Immunodeficiency Virus
    AIDS - Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (caused by HIV)
    CIN - Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia
    Dx - Medical Abbreviation for Diagnosis
I have been digging into this dataset and have read several other analyses in which the 4 target variables have been identified as Biopsy, Schiller, Hinselmann, and Citology.

Looks like the Dx variables are previous diagnoses and the other tests Schiller, Hinselmann, and Citology are available as predictors for Biopsy. In my analysis, I ended up using Biopsy as the target for classification.

Meanwhile, there are 4 target variables or labels: Hinselmann,
Schiller, Cytology and Biopsy. Hinselmanns test refers to colposcopy
using acetic acid. Meanwhile, colposcopy using Lugol iodine includes
Schillers test, cytology and biopsy.

I just found the detailed variable description here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8070120/all-figures
